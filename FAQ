Q) I start my application and I don't see anything? It worked before!

A) If running a tutorial or demo:
      Try:
      
          (let ((swank::*default-pathname-defaults* #P"~/common-lisp/clog/"))
             (clog-user:start-tutorial))
             

      Alternatively:

      Start the application / emacs and slime in your local directory of clog (eg. ~/common-lisp/clog)

      Or you can use (setf clog::*overide-static-root* #P"~/common-lisp/clog/static-files/")
      to overide the static path in (clog:initialize)

   If running your own app. Make sure the :static-file key is set correctly on (clog:initialize)

Q) How do I turn my CLOG app in to a native Mac, Windows or Linux app?

A) There are many ways, the simplest is just use Ceramic -
    http://ceramic.github.io/  which uses electron. You can of course use any
tool the gives you a browser control. See clog/nativ-glues/gtk or an example
with GTK in C, but you can use the cl-cffi-gtk to accomplish the same thing.

Q) I want to take an HTML snapshot of a clog created page:

(format t "=> ~A" (outer-html (document-element (html-document body))))
